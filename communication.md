## Lemur Animal Communication
* Their tail can also be used as a form of communication when wafted through the air while carrying a scent.
* Lemurs communicate more with scents and vocalizations than with visual signals.
* Lemurs have long snouts (compared to the short snouts of haplorrhines) that are traditionally thought to position the nose for better sifting of smells.
* To communicate with smell, which is useful at night, lemurs will scent mark with urine as well as scent glands located on the wrists, inside elbow, genital regions, or the neck
