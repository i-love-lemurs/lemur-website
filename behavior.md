## Lemur Behavior
* Lemurs forage for fruit, which makes up the greater part of their diet, but also eat leaves, flowers, tree bark, and sap.
* Lemurs use concealment and camouflage to protect themselves. They also have prodigious leaping ability to flee from predators. * When in groups, they watch and listen and alert each other with different warning calls for diverse predators such as mammals, snakes and birds. They also listen for the alarm calls of nearby non-predatory birds.
* Lemurs regularly sleep in caves or holes in trees. Lemurs hibernate for several months of the year.
