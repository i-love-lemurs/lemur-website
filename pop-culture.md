Eventually,after climbing mountains, taking trains and going through the air in a balloon, he finally thinks that he has lost them."

### MISREPRESENTATION

Not Evil
* A large number of the Malagasy people believe aye aye lemurs are an evil omen and a symbol of death. The belief is that when the Aye aye points its long middle finger at someone they've been marked for death. As a result, it is actively hunted (which may contribute to its extinction).
